# CountIt

Welcome to CountIt!

CountIt is a simple counter app that provides up to 16 counters, implemented as
a grid of Buttons. Each button shows the counter's value and an optional label.
Pressing the button increases the counter by 1.

Longpressing the button brings up a dialog that lets the user change the counter's
label, enter a value directly, and decrease the counter, increase it, or reset it
to zero via 3 buttons.

There's also a menu item/action bar button to reset all counters to 0 and a settings
screen where the number of counters can be selected between 1 and 16 and the labels
can be set directly.

Counter values, number of counters, and labels persist between app restarts.
